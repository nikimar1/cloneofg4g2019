I was unable to figure out how to compile the renderer module after my code changes. 
Thus I was also unable to implement sobel edge detection.
I attempted looking at PostProcessMotionBlur.cpp h and usf files
as well as the postprocessbloomsetup cpp and h files and the postprocessbloom usf file. I was unable to get this project working.

my console variable is declared as follows:
/////my stuff
static TAutoConsoleVariable<int32> CVarmypostprocess(
	TEXT("r.mypostprocess"),
	0,
	TEXT("HACK: Set to 1 to use my post process"),
	ECVF_RenderThreadSafe);
/////	

so it would be known as r.mypostprocess.

Here is a video of said non-working project:

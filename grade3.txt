Assignment 3 Grading Rubric

35/35 - Basics
   5 /5 - Created assn3 project using Rolling C++ template
   5 /5 - Necessary files checked in (uproject, Config/, Content/)
   5 /5 - Transient files not checked in (including Binaries/,
         DerivedDataCache/, Intermediate/, Saved/, etc.)
   5 /5 - Multiple checkins during development
   5 /5 - Did not use github web upload
   5 /5 - Relevant comments in assn3.txt
   5 /5 - Include link to video file demonstrating project
40/40 - C++ Pawn
   5 /5 - Created a new C++ Pawn
   5 /5 - Mesh and physics initialization
    5/5 - Created neighbor detection sphere
    5/5 - Added TSet<Actor*> to class, either not UPROPERTY or with Transient
    5/5 - Initialize TSet in BeginPlay
    5/5 - Created and registered OnComponentBeginOverlap function
    5/5 - Created and registered OnComponentEndOverlap
    5/5 - Update TSet in BeginOverlap/EndOverlap
21/25 - Behavior
  5  /5 - Tick enabled (bCanEverTick set to true, Super::BeginPlay() called, Tick exists)
  4  /5 - Tick computes average position and cohesion force
  3  /5 - Tick computes average velocity and alignment force
  4  /5 - Tick computes correctly scaled avoidance force
  5  /5 - Forces are balanced for reasonable behavior
0/20 - Extra credit
   0 /5 - Capsule creation & overlap functions
   0 /5 - Capsule position stays with ball at one end
  0  /5 - Capsule direction & size align with velocity
  0  /5 - Avoidance forces for boids in capsule
----
96/100 - Total (120 with extra credit)

#velocity and alignment forces
#Cohesion and position of all balls
#AVoidance needs to be scaled properly

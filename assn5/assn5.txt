I believe everything works but I am uncertain about that. 
The imported texture looks exactly as it should in the two views in editor. 
However, I get errors I do not understand when I try to apply it to a default generated material.
It might be the case that this is simply a seperate thing beyond the scope of the project. 
I did see something about uv layers being used to apply a texture to a material while the scope 
of the project was only creating a material importer. Those uvw items needed for a volume texture are what give me an error.
Furthermore, I wanted to mention that my material importer uses rightchop to remove parts of substrings. 
It is therefore dependent on correct formatting (though it ignores case).
Formatting has to basically match the bucky.mhd file except that one can probably get away with using extra spaces after the equal sign.
We were not told to debug for proper string formatting or extract values in any particular way, 
so I took the liberty of assuming if the file is formatted wrong, it should have an error.
